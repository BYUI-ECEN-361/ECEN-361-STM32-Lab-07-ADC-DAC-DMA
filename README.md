# ECEN-361-STM32-Lab-08-Sampling-Solution

## BYU-I  Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering

## Overview / Purpose
The purpose of this lab is to introduce the student to DAC output, DMAs, and the tradeoffs in timing and sampling.  This lab will be done in two parts -- this is the first, which focuses on the Analog Output.  


All of the lab will start from a pre-built STM32 'Project.'  If you're reading this, you've probably already accepted and cloned the project into your STM32CubeIDE workspace.  If you need help do that, see the instructions [HERE](./Documentation/Working_with_Labs_from_Github_Classroom_Repository.pdf).

Open and follow the instructions found in the WORD document in your cloned repo: 

>/Documentation/Assignment.md

Modify the document with answers when finished, then commit your repository to github. The commit will upload this document as well and serves as the lab submission.

After committing and pushing to github, be sure to finish the assignment by pasting the URL of this repo into the iLearn Assignment.
